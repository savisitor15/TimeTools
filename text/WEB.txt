The time button on the left displays the current ingame day and time (dd-hh:mm). Note that it is different from your playing time in real seconds (as a mod like [url=https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=92&t=13837]EVO-GUI[/url] can display it). It is the time corresponding to the ingame days and night cycle.

If you click on the time button, it pauses the time (but not the game) and the time becomes red. Click again to resume ; the time becomes green again

If you click on the second button, it switches between classical night/day mode and continuous daylight (where time is frozen at 12:00).

With the three last buttons, you can tweak the game speed :
- click on "<" or ">" to decrease or increase game speed from /8 to x64.
- click on the game speed button to directly revert to x1 normal speed, or to switch instant to last memorized speed if you are already in normal speed.

If you did researched the Circuit Network technology, you now have access to a Clock Combinator item that provides an access to several variables/signals :
[list]
[*]current game tick (from the beginning of the game)
[*]current day
[*]current hour
[*]current minute
[*]always day status (0: night&day, 1: always daylight)
[*]current darkness (from 0 to 100%)
[*]current lightness (from 0 to 100%), inverse of darkness.[/list]

If you want to change the clock settings, you can use the remote interface from the console :
/c remote.call( "timetools", "setclock", hour.minute )  ex: /c remote.call( "timetools", "setclock", 9.27 ) to set at 09:27am

you can also enable/disable the time display (if you want to keep only the combinator part), using
/c remote.call( "timetools", "off" )
and
/c remote.call( "timetools", "on" )

You can also edit the config.lua file if you want to lower the maximum speed, or change the clock refresh rate.[/spoiler]

You can probably find some of these features in other separate mods, but I gather them into one simple mod with a tiny gui bar.

Thanks for GopherAtl and his [url=https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=93&t=14671]Nixie Tubes[/url] mod that I use to display numbers in my last screenshot.

The classic display of the first screenshot is from my [url=https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=93&t=24720]SmartDisplay[/url] mod.
